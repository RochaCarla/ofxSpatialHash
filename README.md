==============

#Description

A collection of 2D/3D spatial hashing algorithms.  Useful for quick nearest neighbor calculations in 2- and 3-d.

Allows for an all-in-one approach to spatially indexing existing point clouds for rapid 2D/3D search.

Inspired by https://github.com/neilmendoza/ofxNearestNeighbour/ and others.

See class documentation and examples for more information.
